        <p>Technology has changed the structure and future of sectors it has touched to provide a new way of understanding. Even in the field of plant biology and genomics it has sought to provide effective data management, visualization, integration, analysis, modeling and prediction. Bioinformatics is a vast field that organizes and uses the function of biological systems to track changes in plants, combining plants and technology. This can come in the form of identifying plant physiology, pathogen pressure or the environment to provide valuable insights. Take for example how we have long used genomics to further crop yields and trace the evolutionary history of crops. There is only going to be more application of technology in plant sciences, not less to provide a modern approach.</p>

        <p> Bioinformatics is a multidisciplinary field that uses subjects that could be seemingly unconnected such as computer science, biology, and statistics to analyze the vast amount of data we accumulate overtime. In plant breeding especially their benefit has been in genomic analysis where it helps the analysis of large-scale genomic data and looking at DNA sequencing data and even look for variations or mutations that occur to track changes. Visualization is also an incredible benefit from the technology that is utilized to make meanigful insights from complex datasets and facilitate good decion making for researchers,scientists and even policymakers.  </p>

        <h3>Modern Applications of Bioinformatics</h3>

        <p> Salt salinity also known as soil salinity is when high levels of soluble salts are present in the soil. Salinization has become an apparent problem in recent years due to ineffective drainage systems and irrigation. Agriculture and crop production have been widely impacted by the salinization of land as plant growth cannot flourish in high levels of salt concentration land. Within the plant specifically an osmotic stress occurs where the concentration is off balance. This ends up making the plants harder to extract water from the soil. Furthermore, this leads to ionic toxicity and disrupted mineral intake. 
        Bioinformatics can help discover salinity resistant plants and understand the mechanism behind them using a transgenic approach and help researchers in finding a solution to this growing problem. This is through the development of plants that have certain genes when it comes to resistance in salinated soil, which requires combing through the enormous DNA material out there in plants. Functional annotation is another method utilized by researchers to assign function to novel genes that can be discovered in salt stress studies and help in unraveling the biochemical and physiological processes going in the background. This would overall aid in the development of salt-tolerant crops and have sustainable agriculture in regions where this is a significant problem.  </p>
